```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
  knit: (function(input_file, encoding) {
    out_dir <- 'docs';
    rmarkdown::render(input_file,
      encoding=encoding,
      output_file=file.path(dirname(input_file), out_dir, 'index.html'))})
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
